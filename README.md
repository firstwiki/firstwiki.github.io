FIRSTwiki: main site
====================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/firstwiki/wiki](https://badges.gitter.im/firstwiki/wiki.svg)](https://gitter.im/firstwiki/wiki)

FIRSTwiki is an open-content encyclopedia about the FIRST Robotics Competition,
designed to provide a useful resource for all aspects of the FIRST community.
Following the tenets of gracious professionalism, members contribute back to the
community by recording useful information that other members can benefit from. 

FIRSTwiki is a different kind of wiki, hosted on github pages instead of on a
traditional wiki platform. See http://firstwiki.github.io/docs/contributing
for more information. It's unclear how well this form of wiki will work, but
it's worth the experiment. :)
