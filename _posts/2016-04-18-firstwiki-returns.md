title: FIRSTwiki returns
---

After spending a few years in the depths of the internet, FIRSTwiki is back
(well, sorta). I grabbed a copy of it from the wayback machine, converted it to
markdown, and started creating a structure to allow us to put it back together!

Over the last few years (especially for technical topics), I've noticed that
there are a lot of repetitive questions on ChiefDelphi asking about this thing
or another, and there really needs to be a community-maintained location to
store information that is readily available to FIRST teams. FIRST does a good
job providing information in some areas, but they only have so many resources.
FIRSTwiki aims to be a complementary resource that teams can use to either find
information or pointers to information.

There's still a LOT of work to do! In particular, you may notice that there
really isn't any content here initially, and the site design is very plain.
There's a ton of [old content from the original
FIRSTwiki](https://github.com/firstwiki/original_archive) that needs to be
copied to this site -- I didn't want to directly copy it wholesale, but would
rather have people curate the content and only put the interesting/relevant data
here.

See our [contribution guide](/docs/contributing/), and feel free to issue a
pull request with your changes!
